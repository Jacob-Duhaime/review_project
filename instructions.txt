Welcome to the 212 final grade calculator! 

The purpose of this program is to calculate your CSC 2212 final grade based on your performance on assignments, labs, exams,
final project, MEC project. After the program is done calculating your grade, it will spit out a funny message depending on 
your performance in this class.

<><><><><><><><><><><><>Program Description<><><><><><><><><><><><>

The algorithm for this program takes for input the name of the member that you wish to gather their grade from and the 
algorithm will take that name, go into a data set of vectors that has the index of each team member and it will return 
the calculation for that user's grade based on their index. For example, if Bob Smith is the input and Bob Smith equals 
index 1, that will return the data from index 1 from all of the vectors and it will calculate it to a final grade. The 
data set used for this program is static (meaning that it was set manually by a user) but it can be changed and will be
demonstrated in the video showing how to execute our program. Once you input the name of the data member, it will output
a double which has the final calculated grade based on your performance. 

The development for this program was important to our group because it helped all of us learn and grow more as a team.
One of the main things we ran into a lot in the beginning was on how to tackle the creation of this program. There were
many variety of ideas, many ranging from simple, more complex, more advanced, you name it and it was though of during
the drafting period for this program. 

<><><><><><><><><><><><>How to Compile<><><><><><><><><><><><>

>>>>>>>>>>>>GETTING STARTED<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

In order to compile the program, you will have to go the main folder where the program lives. After you download it, feel
free to extract it anywhere into your computer. To compile, you will open an IDE of your choice. You want to change directory
(cd) into the directory where you have extracted the program. For example, if the program was extracted into a folder onto your 
desktop named "calculator", you will input something like this into your terminal: " cd/desktop/calculator ". After your IDE
is in the directory where the program lives, you will then proceed to compile it by typing "g++ EDIT.cpp EDIT2.CPP". If successful, 
this will then create another file called "a.out". 

>>>>>>>>>>>>RUNNING THE PROGRAM<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

After the program has been successfully compiled, we will then proceed to run it. Once again in your terminal, you will want to
type in the following into your terminal: " ./a.out ". This will trigger the program into running. Once the program is running,
it till ask you for a <STRING> input for the name of the user you want to calculate the grade for. For example, you will type in 
"Jacob" or "jacob" in order to get Jacob's data and get his final course grade. (NOTE: This program is only meant to calculate the 
grade of the individuals associated to this group. The next module will show how to change the names and the grades for each of the 
items).

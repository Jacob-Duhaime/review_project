<h2>Project Description </h2>
<br>
The purpose of this project is to apply all of the knowledge used in CSC 211 and some of the knowledge put into CSC 212 and create a nice program that is going to calculate your CSC 212 final grade based on your performance on assignments, labs, exams, final project, MEC project. After the program is done calculating your grade, it will spit out a funny message depending on your performance in this class (you really don't want to get the funny message that is associated with hacing a gread below a 60).
